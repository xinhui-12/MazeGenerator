This is my BASC3323 Computer Game Technology Assignment. This is a maze generator API where the user can generate different pattern of maze with different settings. The Prim's algorithm is using in this maze generator.

The setting of the maze can also be change in the unity as the setting is a scriptable object.

<b>Additional description</b>
<br/>The starting side property can be chosen by either one of four selections which are “Left”, “Right”, “Up”, and “Down”. The side indicates which border of the maze to choose for the starting. The starting index property is selecting the index of the cells. As shown in the figure below, the index position is based on the chosen side property. For example, the “Up” property is chosen, and the index property is represented in red colour. The side and index concepts are the same for the starting and ending.
